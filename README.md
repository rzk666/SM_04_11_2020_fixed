# Razi's Home Task v1.0
* This project is using React & Redux /w redux-thunk for api's
* This project is structured based on the MVC approach, seperating each page to page(model) / view / controller
* Linting: ESlint abnb with some minor personal adjustments
* This project assumes that the server is using a NoSQL DB such as MongoDB, so fetching a user without actually populating its tasks is a possible cheap action

## Misc. Notes
* This version (v1.0) is roughly working in a very naive way
* I know this task is far from perfect, but I atleast can explain every single choice I made, and know atleast some of its pros \ cons

## TODOS
* Presist data on client inside of removing it to prevent unnecessary fetches(!)

## Run Locally
npm install
npm start

## Thanks for your time!
